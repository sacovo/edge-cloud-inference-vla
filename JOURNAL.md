## 2026-10-28: Two-stage latent (FAST fine-tune, then freeze); listening-robot idea parked

- Decision (author): train the backbone. A frozen backbone performs worse, both in the author's experiments and per π*0.6 / RECAP (arXiv 2511.14759). Autoregressive FAST+ action-token fine-tuning helps a lot.
- Two-stage pipeline: fine-tune `pi05_base` on FAST tokens using diverse robot data, then freeze it and train the fast-policy grid on its fixed latent. One backbone run serves the whole grid.
- Primary latent `z-ft-div` excludes LIBERO from fine-tuning, consistent with avoiding the `pi05_libero` skew. Variants: `z-ft-lib` (adds LIBERO train demos) and `z-frozen` (raw, ablation). Readouts: R1 (prefix, one forward pass, primary) and R2 (first 8 decoded FAST-token states). New `slow-only` reference: the fine-tuned backbone used directly as a policy.
- Added `literature/bib/06-experiment-design.bib` (FAST, π*0.6, PaliGemma 2), generated from arXiv metadata; the hook verified it.
- Parked idea: an actively listening robot (slow conversation-context latent + fast backchannel model on audio cues). See `docs/ideas/active-listening-robot.md`.

## 2026-10-28: EXP-0001 starts on LIBERO (Phase A)

- Decision (author): start with an existing suite and existing demos, and build our own dataset only if the concept shows up.
- Phase A runs on LIBERO, replaying the demos to get multi-rate sensors, torque, F/T and ground-truth state. LIBERO-Goal (fixed layout, so task ID should suffice) acts as a control for Spatial/Object (where layout or object varies, so scene state is needed).
- Pre-registered Phase A criteria: A-test (does the suite need state?), A-z (does z recover ≥50% of the oracle gap?), and A-control (does z help less on Goal?). Phase B (bootstrapped event/dynamic tasks) starts only if A-z and A-control pass.
- Risk noted: `pi05_base` pretraining may include LIBERO. Check this in A0.
- Next: A0 infrastructure.

## 2026-10-28: EXP-0001 decisions (slow model, demos, onboard profile)

- Slow model: `pi05_base` only, not `pi05_libero`, which was fine-tuned on LIBERO and would skew z. Added PaliGemma 2 28B as the generic ~27B remote model.
- The author noted that π0.5 (~3B) fits on a Jetson but is too slow to output actions for control. That leads to a second deployment profile: both loops on the Jetson, with the 3B model as a slow loop emitting only z and a tiny fast policy on top. This is the same research question with a different latency model (fixed compute delay instead of network jitter), so it went into EXP-0001 as profile P-onboard rather than a new experiment.
- Demos: teleop a few seed episodes, train ACT or SmolVLA, keep successful rollouts, retrain, and add manual episodes where needed. The author's RECAP-on-SmolVLA work is an option for improving the collector. Watch for success-filter bias toward easy states and too few recoveries.

## 2026-10-27: EXP-0001 designed (task-ID vs state crossover)

- Scope decision: manipulators are the primary platform, because training data and sim environments are plentiful. Drones were one example and are now optional (E4).
- Author's hypothesis: a large fast policy uses the MLLM latent only as a task ID. Below some size the latent has to carry scene state, the task-ID substitute fails, and staleness starts to matter.
- Author's key ablation: a fully blind fast policy (proprio + torque + wrist F/T). All scene state must then come through z.
- Added a delayed-oracle condition, so that "z lacks state" can be told apart from "state too old".
- Design fixed in advance in `experiments/EXP-0001-latent-taskid-vs-state/README.md`: hypotheses H0–H3, pass/fail criteria, and stages S0–S3. S1 is an oracle-only pilot with no VLM, which checks that the tasks need scene state before any VLM compute is spent.
- Next: S0. Resolve the open decisions (which VLM, how to generate demos for the event/dynamic tasks, LIBERO defaults) and build the delay/multi-rate env wrapper.

## 2026-10-27: Rapid scoping review completed

- Ran the review per `literature/PROTOCOL.md`: 5 themes, each searched by its own agent. The result is 147 deduplicated references, with every arXiv ID checked against the arXiv API.
- Closest prior work: AsyncVLA (arXiv 2602.13476), CloudEdgeVLA (arXiv 2608.00569), Figure Helix. Key gaps:
  - no fast-policy size sweep under a VLM latent
  - no explicit latent-age input under jitter
  - no fusion of IMU, torque, camera and a remote latent
  - no drone platform
  - no slow model around 27B
- Main threat to the experiments: the latent may encode only which task is being done (OpenHelix). The size sweep needs no-latent and task-ID-only baselines.
- Tooling: added a hook that verifies the bibliography. It caught that a wrong title with a reused arXiv ID was silently dropped as a duplicate during the merge, so `verify_bib.py` now checks the per-theme source files directly.
- Next: E0 from `literature/SYNTHESIS.md` §5. Pick the simulator and the 27B VLM, then precompute embeddings for LIBERO.
